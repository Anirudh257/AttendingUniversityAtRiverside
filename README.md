# Attending the University Of California At Riverside

This repo is inspired from the excellent [AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo](https://github.com/snigi-gupta/AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo) which collates important resources and advice that the author, [Snigdha Gupta](https://gist.github.com/snigi-gupta/04307be1585712b0410f91061ea16cb5) found useful during her stay at UB. To avoid duplicity, I will only add resources that are specific to UC Riverside. This repo will receive continuous updates in the future.

A lot of this content is taken from amazing slides/talks by [Naman Mital](https://www.mittalnaman.com/) and [Rugved Bhise](https://rugvedb133.github.io/)
