# AttendingUniversityAtRiverside

This repo is inspired from the excellent [AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo](https://github.com/snigi-gupta/AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo) which collates important resources and advice that the author, [Snigdha Gupta](https://gist.github.com/snigi-gupta/04307be1585712b0410f91061ea16cb5) found useful at her stay in UB. To avoid duplicity, I will only add resources that are specific to UC Riverside students only. I plan to keep updating this repository with more experience.

A lot of this content is taken from amazing slides/talks by [Naman Mital](https://www.mittalnaman.com/) and [Rugved Bhise](https://rugvedb133.github.io/)
