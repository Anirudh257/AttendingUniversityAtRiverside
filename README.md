# AttendingUniversityAtRiverside

This repo is inspired from [AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo](https://github.com/snigi-gupta/AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo) which collates important resources 
and advice that the author, [Snigdha Gupta](https://gist.github.com/snigi-gupta/04307be1585712b0410f91061ea16cb5) found useful at her stay in UB. To avoid
duplicity, I will add resources that are specific to UC Riverside students only. I plan to keep updating this repository as my course continues.
