# Internships & Full-Time Opportunities

## General Advice

* UCR's Fall Quarter starts late in September compared to August in most other universities.
* Start applying to internships or full-time opportunities early in the August i.e., when you're still in your home country. This may put you at the same level as students at other universities who start earlier.
* Networking and referrals are vital in getting an interview call from your dream organization.
* Attend large-scale networking events like [GHC](https://ghc.anitab.org/)[**Women only**], [SWE](https://swe.org/)[**Society of Women Engineers**][**Women only**]. Look into these resources:

## Preparation Advice

* Pick any programming language - C++/Java/Python/JavaScript etc. and master it.
* Brush up your Algorithms & Data Structures.
* Enter [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com). 
* [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice) has excellent compilation of problems for interview preparation. If you're already good at DSA, go for **Blind 75**. If you're relatively a novice, go for **NeetCode 150**
* These 75 or 150 problems teach you most common patterns of questions asked in tech interviews. The goal is not to remember solutions, but to be able to recognize pattern from a new problem and be able to solve it.
* Start working on problems for each pattern you practise. There's always a compilation of problems grouped by patterns. For example, [this post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/448285/List-of-questions-sorted-by-common-patterns).
* After you're confident about your depth and breadth of theory and problems, start applying to companies.
* Now, start targeted practice. Every company has an own way of assessing candidates. Leetcode provides a compilation of most frequently asked interview questions, grouped by companies.
* If you're targeting SDE2 / SE2 / Senior SDE - a strong grip on System Design is necessary. 
* Start System Design preparation with [this post](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) and then [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321).
* Most of the interview questions focus on - Trees, Graphs, Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Binary Search, Linked Lists & Back Tracking.
