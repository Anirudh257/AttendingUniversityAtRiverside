# Internships & Full-Time Opportunities

## General Advice

* UCR's Fall Quarter starts late in September compared to August in most other universities.
* Start applying to internships or full-time opportunities early in August i.e., when you're still in your home country. This may put you at the same level as students at other universities who start earlier.
* Networking and referrals are vital in getting an interview call from your dream organization.
* Attend large-scale networking events like [GHC](https://ghc.anitab.org/)[**Women only**], [SWE](https://swe.org/)[**Society of Women Engineers**][**Women only**]. Look into these resources:

* Use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) for networking, referrals and applying.

* Some great advice on resumes can be found here: https://blog.dataengineer.io/p/how-to-craft-the-perfect-data-engineer
* Don't underestimate the power of an effective cold-email. Getting the attention of the hiring manager/HR via a well-written cold email would go a long way in getting a callback. I found the advice mentioned here helpful: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/cold-email-for-job. A good template can be found here: https://uvasrg.github.io/prospective/ which can be modified depending on the job type.
* Use [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi) for salary information.
* Monitor [summer2023-internships](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships) for summer 2023 internships.
* Learn the art of negotiation. Don't accept an offer without negotiation. Check https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/ for good advice.

## Preparation Advice

* Pick any programming language - C++/Java/Python/JavaScript etc. and master it.
* Brush up your Algorithms & Data Structures.
* Enter [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com). 
* [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice) has an excellent compilation of problems for interview preparation. If you're already good at DSA, go for **Blind 75**. If you're relatively a novice, go for **NeetCode 150**
* These 75 or 150 problems teach you the most common patterns of questions asked in tech interviews. The goal is not to remember solutions but to be able to recognize a pattern from a new problem and be able to solve it.
* Start working on problems for each pattern you practice. There's always a compilation of problems grouped by patterns. For example, [this post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/448285/List-of-questions-sorted-by-common-patterns).
* After you're confident about your depth and breadth of theory and problems, start applying to companies.
* Now, start targeted practice. Every company has its way of assessing candidates. Leetcode provides a compilation of the most frequently asked interview questions, grouped by companies.
* If you're targeting SDE2 / SE2 / Senior SDE - a strong grip on System Design is necessary. 
* Start System Design preparation with [this post](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) and then [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321).
* Most of the interview questions focus on - Trees, Graphs, Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Binary Search, Linked Lists & Back Tracking. 

## Machine-Learning specific advice

* Compared to software engineering, machine-learning interviews have fewer resources.
* Before preparing for an ML role, it is imperative to know the actual requirements. For example, does it require building pipelines/ or deploying ML models/or is it more research-focused?
* A good way to revise fundamentals is to do ML courses in your degree.
* The popularity of ML has led to an explosion of roles across various domains like LLMs, Generative AI, etc. Some roles have an explicit **MS** or **PhD** requirement (mostly research-oriented), but many have relaxed requirements. **Don't apply to a role if you don't meet these basic requirements**.
* **In my opinion, the best way to improve the chances of callbacks is to do relevant projects in the domain**. For example, if the role specifically mentions LLMs, and you haven't worked on it, the chances of a callback is minimal.
* Most ML interviews comprise of these 5 rounds:

| Type of Round | Resources |
|  --------  |  -------  |
| Coding | Similar to the software-engineer role. If you are a beginner, consider https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-java. **Practicing all the patterns is the key.** |
| ML coding | Code ML algorithms from scratch like Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, etc. A good list is found here: https://github.com/alirezadir/Machine-Learning-Interviews/blob/main/src/MLC/ml-coding.md |
| ML system design | It is similar to the system design round in the software engineering interview. Some recommended resources are https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-System-Design-Interview/dp/1736049127 |
|ML Breadth| Testing of basic ML fundamentals like gradient descent, linear regression, etc. Check Chapter 7 of https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/contents/7.1-basics.html.  |
|ML depth | It is more specific to your projects in the resume. For example, if you have worked primarily with NLP, expect questions on BERT, Transformer model. **Know the ins and outs of every project mentioned in your resume.** |
|Behavioural | These questions gauge your personality and how you overcame challenges. Follow the **STAR** formula to answer questions as noted here: https://gist.github.com/katiestutts/7aef5063ba93616a594ac3f3764f8788. Another good resource is: https://www.interviewkickstart.com/career-advice/situational-scenario-based-interview-questions-answers. |

* Some companies might focus more on MLE and hence focus more on **ML coding** and **ML System design** rounds. More **research-oriented roles** will focus on **ML depth**. **There is no hard and fast rule**.

## Resources

* **Tip**: Just a list of resources. Grinding everything will not land you a job. Focus and targeted practice are key.
