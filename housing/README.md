## Important Tips on Housing

* A good resource to find different housing options can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W733qxThpY85sFvdtwqIgfTo8M7L_X367VxTHVOBUYM/edit#gid=1442012155) and [here](https://github.com/Anirudh257/AttendingUnivesityOfCaliforniaAtRiverside/blob/main/housing/ISI%20Apartment%20Guide%2C%202021%20(1).xlsx).

* **Apply for housing immediately after receiving your admission, possibly in June/July.**

* If you are an international MS student, the chances of getting on-campus housing are very low. It is always better to keep other options open.
