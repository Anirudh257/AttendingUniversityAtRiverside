### Important advice from seniors

* Register for the courses as soon as possible as the enrollment is First Come First Serve basis. UCR provides a waiting list for most of the courses. Enroll in a waiting list if the course is full.

* UCR follows a quarter system instead of a usual semester system. This implies that most courses are just 10 weeks long and hence it is important to keep 
the course load optimal, and take only one core/hard course per quarter.

* Examples of hard courses - Machine Learning, Design & Analysis of Algorithms, DBMS, Advanced OS, Architecture etc. If you are taking a hard course, combine it with easier courses.

* Avoid hard courses in the first quarter.

* [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/search/teachers?query=*&sid=1076) is a good resource to understand more about a professor's class.

* A very good advice from https://www.snigdhagupta.com/ was to select courses based on your career objectives. For example, if your goal is to become a backend engineer, courses like **distributed systems**, and **principles of computing** should be in your course list. For ML Engineers, courses like **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing** should be a part of the course list.
