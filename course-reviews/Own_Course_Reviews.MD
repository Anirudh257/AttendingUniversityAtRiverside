Similar to [Snigdha's course reviews](https://github.com/snigi-gupta/AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo/blob/main/Computer%20Science%20Important%20Tips/CourseReview.md), I have collated mine and my friends' course experiences that can help incoming and current students in their course selection. Feel free to add a pull-request if you want to add your own experiences!

**Advanced OS by Dr. Kim** | As a CS student, I had to take 2 out of 3 core courses and I chose Operating Systems as I enjoyed it as an undergraduate. While this course has commonalities with my previous course, it was more rigorous and I had to spend significant time on my labs. There are multiple graded components in this course: Examinations, Paper reviews, Labs. It is important to choose good team members as finishing the labs along with your coursework can get very hectic. The examinations are straightforward and the professor clearly explains what questions are going to come in the examinations. The critiques can be demanding. I think that this was an easily-scoring core course than its counterparts. Some nuggets of advice from my end are: a) Manage your time efficiently as the quarter system gets over quickly and the labs/critique reviews require sufficient time and effort. b) If you are struggling with the course, talk to the TAs, they are very helpful :).  c) I really liked [Udacity's OS courses](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-operating-systems--ud189) that acts a good review for similar topics. [Neso Academy's OS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRiVhbXDGLXDk_OQAeuVcp2O) is also good if you have doubts.
**Big Data Management by Dr. Eldawy** | Big Data is one of the hot areas with an abundance of job opportunities. The professor does a great job updating the course with industry standards and covers relevant topics like NoSQL, Parquet, RDBMS, Hadoop, etc. For people looking for a job after MS, it is extremely useful! The course content is light and the examinations are easy to score. The main component of this course is the project which accounts for **50%** of the grades. My only advice here is to choose a strong team and distribute the work accordingly. Start working on the project as soon as you decide the topic. If you are a beginner to this field, ask the prof for relevant ideas and seniors/industry professionals for good ideas. A good project done here can help you stand apart from the crowd! 
**Scientific Computing by Dr. Shinar** | This course is an excellent primer to Linear Algebra and the mathematical underpinnings behind Machine Learning, Graphics and other areas. The course can become too fast-paced for many people. It is highly recommended for people getting into research or preparing for ML interviews. Don't take it if you don't like Mathematics. There are many mathematics-proof based assignments in this course. To do well in this course, attend all the classes and take rigorous notes and don't leave things till the last day. I found [Numerical methods](https://www.coursera.org/learn/numerical-methods-engineers#syllabus) and [Applied Linear Algebra & Numerical Analysis](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/am584/am584.html) useful for reviewing some topics.
**Foundations of Machine Learning by Dr. Roy-Chowdhury** | Machine learning is a fast growing field that is disrupting many industries. Plenty of roles require knowledge of Machine Learning like Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Engineers and many more. Irrespective of your objective to enter the industry or continue in the academia, this course is a must. The content covered in the course was extremely beneficial to me in my interviews. This is a fundamental course covering the Mathematical underpinnings and gives a broad overview of the various Machine Learning algorithms. While the assignments are mathematically rigorous, quizzes and examinations are easy. **This course is not trivial and do not leave anything till the last moment.** If you have weak Mathematical foundations, do this course: [MIT Probability course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6).
**Natural Language Generation by Dr. Yue Dong** | Natural Language Generation is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence with widespread applications in customer service, marketing, news article summarization, etc. Being a seminar course, there are no examinations and only a project is required. The course also covers novel Natural Language Generation research works. Making a good project in this course will enhance your resume and make you a good fit for many companies. Being a quarter course, it is better to decide and start working on a topic as soon as possible. If you are a beginner in NLP, check out this [Stanford NLP course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH4v6133s9LFPRHjEmbmJ).
**Advanced Computer Vision by Dr. Amit Roy Chowdhury** | DALLE-3, Diffusion are all built on Computer Vision and Language modalities. It gives a brief overview of the various fields in Computer Vision. There are no examinations in this course but a lot of assignments. Having prior experience in the field is not mandatory but the assignments can get very challenging. The topics in the course were extremely helpful for my interviews in ML companies. No book is followed in this course but one can look at  [First Principles of Computer Vision](https://fpcv.cs.columbia.edu/).
**Reinforcement Learning by Dr. Nanpeng Yu** | RL is another subfield of artificial intelligence getting a lot of attention these days. It has many applications, in gaming and **RLHF**. Many robotics companies have roles using **RL**. Being a seminar course, there were no examinations but there was a project and assignments. I found the course heavy for the quarter system and advice beginners to not take it. Some good online resources are: [Deepmind's RL lectures](https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-lecture-series-2021) and [IIT Madras RL course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ0Hkv_1LHlJtC_wqwVu6RQX).
**Introduction to Deep Learning by Dr. Samet Omyak** | Deep Learning(DL) is one of the major reasons behind ML's popularity and success across various fields. I found the courseload hectic due to six assignments and one final examination along with a final project. It is not advisable to take in the final quarter. Also, people with no prior knowledge will find it difficult. [Stanford's CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course is a great resource for self-study.
