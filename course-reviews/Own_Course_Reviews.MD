Similar to [Snigdha's course reviews](https://github.com/snigi-gupta/AttendingUniversityAtBuffalo/blob/main/Computer%20Science%20Important%20Tips/CourseReview.md), I have collated my own course experiences that can 
help incoming and current students in their course selection. Feel free to add a pull-request if you want to add your own experiences!

**Advanced OS by Dr. Kim** | As a CS student, I had to take 2 out of 3 core courses and I chose Operating Systems as I enjoyed it as an undergraduate. While this course has commonalities with my previous course, it was more rigorous and I had to spend significant time on my labs. There are multiple graded components in this course: Examinations, Paper reviews, Labs. It is important to choose good team members as finishing the labs along with your coursework can get very hectic. The examinations are straightforward and the professor clearly explains what questions are going to come in the examinations. The critiques can be demanding. I think that this was an easily-scoring core course than its counterparts. Some nuggets of advice from my end are: a) Manage your time efficiently as the quarter system gets over quickly and the labs/critique reviews require sufficient time and effort. b) If you are struggling with the course, talk to the TAs, they are very helpful :). 
**Big Data Management by Dr. Eldawy** | Big Data is one of the hot areas with an abundance of job opportunities. The professor does a great job updating the course with industry standards and covers relevant topics like NoSQL, Parquet, RDBMS, Hadoop, etc. For people looking for a job after MS, it is extremely useful! The course content is light and the examinations are easy to score. The main component of this course is the project which accounts for **50%** of the grades. My only advice here is to choose a strong team and distribute the work accordingly. Start working on the project as soon as you decide the topic. If you are a beginner to this field, ask the prof for relevant ideas and seniors/industry professionals for good ideas. A good project done here can help you stand apart from the crowd!
