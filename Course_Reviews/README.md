### Important advice from seniors

* Register for the courses as soon as possible as the seats are opened on a rolling basis.

* UCR follows a quarterly system instead of a usual semester-wise system, that implies that most courses are just 10 weeks long. It is important to keep 
the course load less and take only one core/hard course per quarter.

* Examples of hard courses - ML, Algorithms, DBMS, OS, Architecture

* Avoid Hard courses in first sem/quarter.
